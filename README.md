# Washington Post News Scraper

## Overview

This is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news from The Washington Post. The app uses Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from The Washington Post website.

### How it works...

  1. Whenever a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from The Washington Post and displays them for the user. The app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article

  2. Users are able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The users can delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
